# Sample Data & Report Preview

This folder contains a lightweight starter dataset you can use to validate PBIHoster without connecting to a tenant.

- `sample-sales.csv`: A small sales dataset with region, category, channel, month, revenue, and profit fields.
- `sample-report.svg`: Static preview of the sample report (also served at `/onboarding/sample-report.svg`).

For a quick start, import `sample-sales.csv` into Power BI Desktop, create a few KPI cards and a clustered column chart, and publish to your sandbox workspace. Then replace the demo layout IDs in the app with your real workspace/report IDs.
